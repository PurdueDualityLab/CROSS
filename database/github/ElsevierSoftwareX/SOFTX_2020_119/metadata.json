Decision rule: If it is primarily executed as an end-user program rather than imported as a dependency, label as Application. • Dependency software artifact Definition: A reusable library, package, or module intended to be consumed by other software (including transitive dependency components). Decision rule: If it is imported, linked, or depended upon by other projects as a component, label as Dependency. • Infrastructure Definition: Foundational systems that support execution or deployment environments (for example, containerization frameworks, orchestration infrastructure, runtime platforms). Decision rule: If it provides an environment or substrate upon which research software runs or is deployed, label as Infrastructure. • Runtime instrumentation software Definition: Tools that observe, instrument, profile, or modify behavior at runtime for testing, performance, monitoring, or compliance. Decision rule: If its primary role is runtime observation or modification rather than producing artifacts or distributing them, label as Runtime instrumentation. • Governance software Definition: Systems and processes that control or gate distribution to users (for example, package registries, registry policy checks, repository acceptance checks, curated catalogs). Decision rule: If it mediates how artifacts enter an ecosystem or are distributed at scale, label as Governance software. • Assistant layer software Definition: Interactive assistance tooling embedded in developer or community workflows (for example, chat-based assistants integrated into collaboration platforms that guide usage or development). Decision rule: If the artifact provides interactive guidance, automation, or decision support within the ecosystem rather than being part of build or distribution, label as Assistant layer. • Unknown Definition: Insufficient information to determine role.===========================CLASS 3: Research coupling or Research role (README only)What it captures:How directly the software contributes to producing research results versus supporting the research process. • Direct research execution Definition: Software that directly generates, transforms, or analyzes scientific data or models in a way that contributes to research findings (for example, simulation codes, analysis pipelines, domain tools that produce figures or results). Decision rule: If removing the software would prevent producing the core scientific output (results, models, figures), label as Direct. • Research-support tooling Definition: Software that supports producing research results but is not itself the core analysis or modeling artifact (for example, workflow orchestration, packaging, testing, data management tooling, containerization frameworks, build and release tooling). Decision rule: If the software primarily enables development, execution, reproducibility, deployment, or management of research workflows, label as Support. • Incidental or general-purpose Definition: General software used in research settings but not research-oriented in design or intent (for example, generic OS components, generic editors, general infrastructure unrelated to research goals). Decision rule: If the software is broadly used across domains without being research-specific and is not part of a research toolchain intentionally, label as Incidental. • Unknown Definition: Insufficient information to determine coupling.===========================CLASS 4: Distribution pathway (README only)What it captures:How the software is delivered to downstream users and systems. • Source repo Definition: Primarily distributed by source code repository, with users building or installing directly from source. Decision rule: If the paper emphasizes cloning, building, or installing from a repository without a formal release channel, use Source repo. • Builds and releases Definition: The software is delivered to downstream users primarily through published build artifacts and releases, such as versioned tags and downloadable assets produced via build and release processes (for example, CI workflows, build scripts, packaging, signing, and publishing).  Decision rule: Use Builds and releases when the main unit consumed by users is a published build artifact or release asset, such as a tagged version with attached binaries or archives. • Package registry Definition: Distributed through a registry or ecosystem package manager (for example, CRAN, PyPI, Maven, npm). Decision rule: If installation is described as a single command via an ecosystem registry, use Package registry and specify which. • Containers Definition: Distributed as container images (for example, Docker or OCI images) or heavily dependent on container-based delivery. Decision rule: If the primary operational unit is a container image, use Containers. • Installer or binary Definition: Distributed as compiled binaries, installers, or downloadable executables. Decision rule: If the paper explicitly distinguishes install from binary versus from source, use Installer or binary. • Network service Definition: Delivered as a hosted or networked service (for example, web apps, APIs, managed platforms). Decision rule: If users interact with it over the network rather than installing it, use Network service. • Unknown Definition: Insufficient information to determine pathway.===========================Output requirements:- Output must match the schema exactly.- Provide evidence bullets grounded in README text/metadata given to you.- If uncertain, choose Unknown- distribution_details should be null unless pathway is Package registry or Containers.===========================README:# SWIGLAL: Python and Octave interfaces to LALSuiteSWIGLAL is a collection of scripts used to build [Python][python] and[Octave][octave] interfaces to the [LALSuite][lalsuite] gravitational-wave dataanalysis libraries, written in C.This repository was extracted from the LALSuite development history, in order toillustrate the history of the development of SWIGLAL. The tagged versions ofSWIGLAL correspond to versions of the LAL library, a key component of LALSuitethat provides core routines, including SWIGLAL.## BuildingSWIGLAL is fully integrated to LALSuite, and as such cannot be built directlyfrom this repository. Instructions for obtaining the Python and Octave interfaces,either through pre-built packages or by building from source, are linked to fromthe main [LALSuite][lalsuite] development repository.## OperationSWIGLAL is primarily based on [SWIG][swig], a tool which generates wrapper codefor the public constants, functions, and classes exported by the LALSuite Cheader files.  The generated wrapper code (C for Python, C++ for Octave) is thencompiled to create a dynamically loadable modules, which can then be accessed bye.g. using `import` for Python. This enables LALSuite constants, functions, andclasses to be used directly from Python and Octave.The SWIGLAL scripts build upon the basic wrappers generated by SWIG in thefollowing respects:  * SWIGLAL passes the LALSuite C header files through SWIG twice. The first    pass uses the SWIG `-xml` mode to generate an XML syntax tree describing the    public constants, functions, and classes exported by LALSuite; in essence,    SWIG is used as a C header parser. Information from the XML syntax tree is    used by the script `generate_swig_iface.py` to automate further annotation    of the LALSuite C header files, which are then passed through SWIG a second    time, using either its `-python` or `-octave` mode to generate Python or    Octave wrappers respectively.  * SWIGLAL provides header files, written in C with SWIG preprocessor    directives, which contain code to further integrate the wrappers with    LALSuite. The header `SWIGCommon.i` provide common definitions, while the    headers `SWIGOctave.i` and `SWIGPython.i` provide definitions specific to    Python and Octave. The headers `SWIGLALAlpha.i` and `SWIGLALOmega.i` provide    definitions specific to the LAL library.SWIGLAL includes extensive tests of the Python and Octave wrappers, provided bythe files `SWIGLALTest.h`, `SWIGTest.c`, `SWIGTestLALPython`, and`SWIGTestLALOctave.m`.## DocumentationSWIGLAL is documented as part of LALSuite. The [LALSuite Doxygendocumentation][swiglaldoc] provides detailed documentation of the definitionsprovided by `SWIGCommon.i`, `SWIGLALAlpha.i`, and `SWIGLALOmega.i`.## SupportSWIGLAL is supported as part of LALSuite. The [LALSuite contributingguide][lalsuitectrb] provides information on reporting issues.[lalsuite]:     https://doi.org/10.7935/GT1W-FZ16[lalsuitectrb]: https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[octave]:       https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/[python]:       https://www.python.org/[swig]:         http://www.swig.org/[swiglaldoc]:   https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/lal/group__lal__swig.html## LicenseThe files in this repository are dual-licensed under the GPL 2.0 license (or anylater version), and the MIT (Expat) license.
