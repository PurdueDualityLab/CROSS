    "description": "pyRRG weak lensing shape measurement code. Measuring the 2nd and 4th order moments it uses a TinyTim model to correct for PSF distortions. It is invariant to number exposures, ortientation of the drizzle images. Using a machine learning algorithm it automatically star and galaxy classifies, howeve the user is able to do this manually if not accurate enough. For more see https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905090. For bugs please report them to https://github.com/davidharvey1986/pyRRG or contact harvey@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl",
