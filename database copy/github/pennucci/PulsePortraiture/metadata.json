    "description": "PulsePortraiture (PP): a wideband pulsar timing code written in python.  It uses an extension of Joe Taylor's FFTFIT algorithm (Taylor 1992) to simultaneously measure a phase (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM).  PSRCHIVE, lmfit, and the latest vertsions of numpy and scipy are required.",
