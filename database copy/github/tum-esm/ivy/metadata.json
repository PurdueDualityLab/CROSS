        "\"A Python boilerplate for an IoT node data acquisition system (DAS) supporting remote configuration and software updates. An Ivy-based network is made up of many (remote) computers running autonomously - e.g., performing measurements, controlling actuators, etc. - and a central backend connecting these devices.\"",
