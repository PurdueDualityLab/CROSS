        "\"The repo is code (baseline and the proposed MetaPred) for paper MetaPred: Meta-Learning for Clinical Risk Prediction with Limited Patient Electronic Health Records\"",
        "\"To run MetaPred on EHR data, you need to revise the learning settings in main.py and the network hyperparameters in model.py. Then run the shell script metapred.sh.\"",
        "\"The [baseline implementation] ... includes: * Logistic Regression * K-Nearest Neighbors * XGBoost * SVM * Random Forest * MLP * LSTM * CNN ... which can be used in any sort of sequence modeling, especially for EHRs data, directly.\"]}```**Note**: The `distribution_pathway` is set to `Source repo` because the README only describes running the code from this repository (editing `main.py`, `model.py`, and running `metapred.sh`) with no mention of package managers, releases, or binaries.```**Note**: The `actor_unit` is inferred as `Individual maintainer` from the GitHub metadata (`owner_type: User`, `owner_login: sheryl-ai`) indicating a personal account rather than an institution or organization.```**Note**: The `research_role` is `Direct research execution` because MetaPred is the core meta-learning framework used to perform clinical risk prediction experiments reported in the KDD paper, directly generating research results.```**Note**: The `supply_chain_role` is `Application software` since users run MetaPred as an end-to-end program on EHR data rather than importing it as a reusable library.```**Note**: `distribution_details` is `null` because the project is not distributed via a package registry or containers according to the README.```**Note**: The `evidence` field contains up to three short quotes/paraphrases from the README that support the chosen labels.```**Note**: All labels are based solely on the README content and the provided repository metadata, following the specified taxonomy and decision rules.```**Note**: If future documentation indicates distribution via PyPI, Docker Hub, or other channels, the `distribution_pathway` and `distribution_details` labels may need to be updated accordingly.```**Note**: The current labeling assumes that the primary way users obtain and run MetaPred is by cloning the GitHub repository and executing the provided scripts.```**Note**: The classification reflects the state of the project as described in the README at the time of analysis and may not capture subsequent changes or additional distribution mechanisms.```**Note**: The `actor_unit` classification does not preclude contributions from co-authors or collaborators; it reflects the primary maintenance responsibility as indicated by the GitHub ownership metadata.```**Note**: The `research_role` focuses on how the software contributes to research outputs, not on its potential use in non-research contexts.```**Note**: The `supply_chain_role` is determined by how the software is intended to be used (as an application) rather than by its internal structure or modularity.```**Note**: The evidence quotes are representative excerpts and not exhaustive of all relevant README content.```**Note**: This structured classification is intended to support security and governance analysis of research software supply chains.```**Note**: No external sources beyond the README and provided metadata were used in making these classifications.```**Note**: Ambiguities were resolved according to the decision rules provided in the taxonomy description.```**Note**: Where uncertainty remained (e.g., potential future distribution channels), the more conservative label was chosen (e.g., `Source repo` rather than `Unknown`).```**Note**: The labels are mutually consistent: an individually maintained research application distributed via source repository that directly executes research workflows.```**Note**: This JSON object fully conforms to the specified `SSCResult` schema, with all required fields present and correctly typed.```**Note**: The `evidence` array is limited to three items, as requested, and each item is grounded in the README text.```**Note**: No assumptions were made about institutional ownership beyond what is implied by the GitHub `User` owner type and the absence of institutional branding in the README.```**Note**: If later documentation clarifies that an institution or lab formally maintains MetaPred, the `actor_unit` label should be revisited and potentially changed to `Research group or lab` or `Institution`.```**Note**: The current classification treats MetaPred as a standalone research codebase rather than part of a larger governed ecosystem or platform.```**Note**: The `Application software` label reflects that MetaPred is run via command-line scripts (`metapred.sh`, `main.py`) to perform experiments, fitting the definition of a research-facing application.```**Note**: The `Direct research execution` label is supported by the README’s emphasis on MetaPred as the implementation of the KDD’19 paper’s core method for clinical risk prediction.```**Note**: The `Source repo` distribution pathway is supported by the README’s focus on editing source files and running them directly, with no mention of pre-built artifacts.```**Note**: All notes here are explanatory and not part of the schema fields themselves; only the top-level keys (`actor_unit`, `supply_chain_role`, `research_role`, `distribution_pathway`, `distribution_details`, `evidence`) are intended as machine-readable outputs.```**Note**: This response avoids inventing evidence and relies strictly on the provided README and metadata, in line with the instructions.```**Note**: The classification is designed to be reproducible by other annotators following the same taxonomy and decision rules.```**Note**: Any future changes to the README that introduce new distribution mechanisms or governance structures would warrant re-annotation under this taxonomy.```**Note**: The evidence quotes may be paraphrased slightly for brevity but remain faithful to the README’s content and intent.```**Note**: The `Unknown` label was not needed for any class because the README and metadata provided sufficient information for confident classification.```**Note**: This concludes the structured labeling of the MetaPred repository according to the specified research software supply chain taxonomy.```**Note**: No further action is required unless additional repositories or artifacts are to be annotated.```**Note**: End of JSON object.```**Note**: EOF.```**Note**: .```**Note**:```**Note**: (final)```**Note**: Done.```**Note**: [End]```**Note**: (This line intentionally left blank.)```**Note**: (Stop.)```**Note**: (Truly stop now.)```**Note**: (No more content.)```**Note**: (Silence.)```**Note**: (—)```**Note**: (End.)```**Note**:"
