        "The repository describes a full analysis workflow: reading data, estimating PSDs, running searches, and MCMC refinement (e.g., \"Next up is the search. This is invoked by calling ./search 3 3\" and later running PTMCMC), indicating an end-user analysis application rather than a reusable library.",
        "Commands are given as direct executables compiled from C sources (e.g., \"gcc -o segmentSangria segmentSangria.c -lhdf5 -lgsl\" then \"./segmentSangria\"; similarly for SpecAverage, unique, PTMCMC), implying users run the programs themselves for gravitational-wave data analysis, i.e., direct research execution.",
        "Installation and use are described only via compiling C files with gcc/clang and running the resulting binaries (e.g., \"gcc -o SpecAverage SpecAverage.c -lgsl\" then \"./SpecAverage\"), with no mention of package managers, releases, or containers, implying distribution via the source repository."
