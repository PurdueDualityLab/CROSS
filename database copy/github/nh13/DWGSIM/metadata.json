    "description": "a whole genome simulator for next-generation sequencing based off of wgsim found in SAMtools, which was written by Heng Li, and forked from DNAA. It was modified to handle ABI SOLiD and Ion Torrent data, as well as various assumptions about aligners and positions of indels. Many new features have been subsequently added.",
