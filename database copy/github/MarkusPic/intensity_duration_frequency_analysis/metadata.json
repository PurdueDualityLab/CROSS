    "description": "heavy rain as a function of the duration and the return period acc. to DWA-A 531 (2012)      This program reads the measurement data of the rainfall     and calculates the distribution of the rainfall as a function of the return period and the duration          for duration steps up to 12 hours (and more) and return period in a range of '0.5a <= T_n <= 100a'",
