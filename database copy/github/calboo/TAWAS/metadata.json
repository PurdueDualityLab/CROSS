    "description": "TAWAS is an IDL script for solving the wave equation for torsional Alfvèn waves in a viscous plasma. The background magnetic field is axisymmetric and force-free with no azimuthal component and the plasma beta is assumed to be negligable. The solution is calculated using the analytical formula presented in https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/510/2/1910/6449388?redirectedFrom=fulltext. ",
