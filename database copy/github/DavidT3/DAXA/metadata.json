    "description": "Democratising Archival X-ray Astronomy (DAXA) is an easy-to-use Python module for downloading multi-mission X-ray telescope data and processing it into usable archives. Users can acquire entire archives, or filter observations based on ID/positions/time. Supports XMM; partial support eROSITA, Chandra, NuSTAR, Swift, Suzaku, ASCA, ROSAT, INTEGRAL",
