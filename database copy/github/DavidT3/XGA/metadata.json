    "description": "X-ray: Generate and Analyse is a module designed to make the analysis of XMM observations simple and efficient. It provides an interface with SAS for the creation of XMM data products, as well as a way to easily perform fits (scalable for multiple observations) and retrieve information about an object, all within a Python package.
