    "description": "Kepler K2 Cadence Events (K2CE) is a Python data visualization and manipulation tool for astronomers to identify and remove cadences (observations) associated with problematic thruster events, thus producing cleaner light curves.  K2CE was designed to work with standard Kepler or K2 data products: long-cadence (30 min) and short-cadence (1 min) light curve files and long-cadence and short-cadence target pixel files.  The tool has been modified to work with light curve files and target pixel files from the TESS mission.",
