    "description": "MrMoose  is a Spectral Energy Distribution fitting procedure  using a Bayesian framework. In a nutshell, this code allows to fit user-defined models onto a set of multi-wavelength data, making use of spatial information and upper-limits with a consistent treatment. The code is highly flexible to allow its use for sources with complex structures.",
