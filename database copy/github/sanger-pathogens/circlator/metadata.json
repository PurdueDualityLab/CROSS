    "description": "Circlator is a tool to circularize genome assemblies. The input is a genome assembly in FASTA format and corrected PacBio or nanopore reads in FASTA or FASTQ format. Circlator will attempt to identify each circular sequence and output a linearised version of it. It does this by assembling all reads that map to contig ends and comparing the resulting contigs with the input assembly.",
