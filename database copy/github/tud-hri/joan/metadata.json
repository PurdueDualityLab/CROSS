    "description": "JOAN is an software package that allows to perform human-in-the loop experiments in the open source driving simulator CARLA. JOAN facilitates communication between human input devices and CARLA, the implementation of haptic feedback, systematically storing experiment data, and the automatic execution of experiments with multiple experimental conditions.",
